/**
 * M1 slice 4 (Rechnungsabgleich-DECISIVE match) — closes the functional gap the
 * F1 correction left explicit, then corrected at the independent acceptance
 * review (PROC434 R1-R3):
 *
 * R1 (quantity/identity reconciliation): the decisive match is no longer a
 * quantity-blind amount comparison. It reconciles the BOUND order position
 * (ordered quantity, closed unit/currency/identity), the ACCEPTED goods
 * receipt (the real receipt-entrypoint readback) and the ACTUAL invoice line
 * (the sealed purchase-side source's own quantity) at the procurement level:
 *   - over-invoicing (invoiced > ordered or > accepted) is DENIED
 *     (MATCH_INVOICE_LINE_OVER_INVOICED); it can never read as a match;
 *   - a legitimate PARTIAL invoice (0 < invoiced < ordered, full receipt) is
 *     an explicit UNRESOLVED_PARTIAL_INVOICE with the REMAINING quantity
 *     stated — never a MATCHED decision and never a silent claim shrink;
 *   - an explicit PO-identity mapping (po-identity-mapping source) binds the
 *     local draft's supplier/article/order/position identities to the closed
 *     PO evidence, instead of attaching an unrelated amount reference.
 * The reused ERV amount evaluator (evaluateErvMatchingCaseV1) stays the
 * amount authority; it is not a claim that it performs procurement quantity
 * semantics. The positive fixture is coherent across all three
 * representations (ordered 100 / received 100 / invoiced 100, 2400 EUR
 * minor).
 *
 * R2 (source authenticity): the admitted synthetic invoice/valuation sources
 * are bound to an INDEPENDENTLY RETAINED code-owned approved-source manifest
 * (cm.proc434/procurement-434-approved-sources/v1) that records each source's
 * retained evidence identity (locator/generator/attester) and content seal.
 * A caller's content+self-hash is NOT source authority: a same-ID source
 * re-seal (changed quantity, recomputed digest), a metadata swap (changed
 * locator/generator/attester without rehash) and any content with no retained
 * entry are DENIED (MATCH_INVOICE_LINE_SOURCE_NOT_ADMITTED /
 * MATCH_RECEIPT_VALUATION_SOURCE_NOT_ADMITTED). The loaded AP-04 pack is
 * verified against its frozen identity (byte digest at the path, canonical
 * content digest here, tolerance-policy bytes included) BEFORE evaluation: a
 * STRICT_ZERO tolerance mutation under the same variant name/version is
 * DENIED (MATCH_AP04_PACK_NOT_FROZEN), and the derived ERV evidence preserves
 * the ACTUAL source locator/generator (no substituted fixed locator). The
 * actual provenance reflects the checked bytes.
 *
 * The F1 composition (rechnungsabgleich-v1.ts, byte-identical) runs as the
 * PRECONDITION: every F1 negative gate (owned reader-to-composition
 * boundary, caller-resealed source binding, closed units/currency,
 * over-receipt, partial receipt, no receipt, absent/tampered valuation,
 * unknown/PO supplier, separate-reference rule, source binding, stale
 * window, non-frozen tolerance) is preserved EXACTLY; a DENIED/UNRESOLVED
 * precondition is propagated unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT (closed non-claims, no manufactured evidence):
 *   - It does NOT copy the invoice supplier or line quantity from the PO or
 *     the goods receipt; they come ONLY from the sealed invoice-line source,
 *     which is admitted by the retained manifest and cross-checked (not
 *     word-mapped) against the source-bound reader fact and the closed
 *     PO/supplier identity.
 *   - It does NOT take the invoice AMOUNT from the invoice-line source; the
 *     amount stays the real erp-read reader fact (the F1 amount sub-use), so
 *     the source cannot re-label the amount.
 *   - It does NOT run the decisive match while the F1 precondition is
 *     DENIED/UNRESOLVED; a recomputed SELF digest on the invoice-line source
 *     is NOT an authentication grant; the erp-read source is LOCAL_SYNTHETIC
 *     and the invoice-line source is LOCAL_SYNTHETIC_FIXTURE — no production,
 *     booking or real-integration claim. The ERV core grants no booking
 *     authority (READ_SYNTHETIC / WRITE_LOCAL_PROOF only).
