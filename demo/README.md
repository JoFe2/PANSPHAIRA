# PanSphaira local demo installer

The demo is the bounded implementation example for
[The PanSphaira Canon](../docs/CANON.md). Use
[Architecture](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[Known Limitations](../docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) to distinguish shipped local
behavior from non-claims.

The installer starts a local synthetic CRM/ERP stack and verifies
authenticated provider readiness, mapped fictional identities, a
digest-bound catalog, one governed CRM-to-ERP order flow and the deterministic
Admin-AI preview boundary.

The released local Wave 1 surface adds an Approval Workbench for the
existing synthetic order escalation. It derives the readable business diff
from a bounded provider snapshot, binds its local version plus requester,
purpose, impacts, rollback and Policy, then rechecks freshness at approval and
use. An authenticated local Approve issues a short one-use lease; Reject issues
none. The provider gate and separate decision/effect receipts preserve those
bindings. Stale, hidden, truncated, rejected, tampered, expired and replayed
leases cannot execute. This remains a deterministic static-policy demo with no
real provider transaction/ETag, live LLM or production owner identity.

## Requirements

- Linux x86_64;
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2;
- `jq`, `curl`, OpenSSL and `sha256sum`;
- permission to build the local demo image and create installer-owned Docker
  containers, volumes and networks;
- free loopback ports `7780`, `7781` and `7782`, unless overridden with unique
  `CM_*_PORT` loopback bindings.

Do not use production credentials or real customer data. Initial installation
may download the pinned container images declared in `compose.yaml`.

## Install

From the release root:

```sh
./demo/install.sh
```

The guided defaults select the complete synthetic demo with safe local
authority. The optional `RAMPAGE` profile is a test-lab mode and requires the
explicit `CM_RAMPAGE_CONFIRM=I_UNDERSTAND_LOCAL_DEMO_ONLY` opt-in. It does not
grant host privileges.

Success prints `READY_VERIFIED` and loopback URLs for PanSphaira, EspoCRM and
Dolibarr. An unchanged rerun is idempotent. The Admin-AI PoC uses a
deterministic local policy, not a live LLM or production delegation service.
The dashboard permission X-ray is GET-only and informational: it displays the
exact synthetic profile/assignment/capability/constraint intersection and
issues no executable authority.

The source tree also contains a Wave 3 Paperless-ngx zoo adapter contract. It
is intentionally disabled in this installer (`CM_DMS=off`) and is tested only
against synthetic HTTP fixtures. It reads bounded metadata through fixed GET
paths and has no upload, content-download, delete or arbitrary-URL operation.
The playable stack does not install or claim compatibility with Paperless.

After a SAFE_GUIDED install, the bounded endpoint smoke can be run with:

```sh
./demo/approval-workbench-smoke.sh
```

The script creates one additional fictional Dolibarr order, proves a rejected
proposal cannot act, proves an approved lease acts once, rejects replay, and
writes digest-only evidence under `.chimpmaera-demo/public/`.

## Local runtime state

The installer generates random local demo secrets and state under
`.chimpmaera-demo/`. Per-run diagnostic receipts are written under
`.chimpmaera-acceptance/`. Neither directory belongs in a source or release
archive.

The scheduled/release exact-head gate is documented in
[Current-head Docker E2E](../docs/DEMO-CURRENT-HEAD-E2E.md). Its
`CM_DEMO_RUN_OWNER` input is reserved for the bounded CI runner: it must equal
the isolated Compose project and adds a second ownership label to the locally
built image. Ordinary interactive installs leave it unset.

## Cleanup

Remove only installer-owned resources:

```sh
./demo/uninstall.sh --purge
```

`--purge` removes the locally built demo image only after verifying its
installer ownership label and, when set, its exact E2E run-owner label. Do not
replace this command with Docker pruning or broad filesystem deletion.

`READY_VERIFIED` applies only to the selected local run. It is not a
publication, production, support, performance or security-certification
claim.
